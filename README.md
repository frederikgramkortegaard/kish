### AttentionSplit & OrthAdam
The PyTorch implementation of the AttentionSplit module can be found under `modules/Attentionsplit.py` and OrthAdam can be found under `modules/Optimizer.py`

## Installation
Firstly, the user should install the given requirements file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
thereafter, install the Mujoco physics engine found at:
https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py?tab=readme-ov-file

## Running the code
Inside `playground` all of our tests can be found, these can be ran by either using the `test_x_.py` or `run.py`, the reader should read these files, or use `-help` to familiarize themselves with their options.
